      These data represent values of biomass density for more than 200
      species of macroalgae, invertebrates and fish measured in fixed
      plots at five reefs as part of a long-term experiment designed to
      evaluate the effects of disturbance to giant kelp on the structure
      and productivity of the benthic community. Taxon-specific
      relationships between size and mass were applied to field
      measurements of species abundance to estimate biomass density of
      each species. The five reefs (Arroyo Quemado 34°28.048’N,
      120°07.031’W; Carpinteria 34°23.474’N, 119°32.510’W; Isla Vista
      34°23.275’N, 119°32.792’W; Mohawk 34°23.649’N, 119°43.762’W; and
      Naples 34° 25.342’N, 119° 57.102’W) ranged in depth from 5.8 m to
      8.9 m (MLLW) and were chosen to represent a range of physical and
      biological characteristics known to influence subtidal macroalgal
      assemblages in the region. A common (but not always persistent)
      feature on these reefs was the presence of the giant kelp, which
      forms a dense canopy at the sea surface that suppresses
      recruitment and growth of understory algae below it.

      Field measurements of percent cover or size specific density were
      converted to biomass for each species of algae, invertebrate, and
      fish recorded using taxon specific relationships
      “https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127”.
      Percent cover or size specific density of rare species was
      converted to biomass using relationships derived for
      morphologically similar taxa. Please see the protocol below for
      details of how biomass was calculated.

               The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
            
         
         
            SBC LTER is supported by the National Science Foundation.
