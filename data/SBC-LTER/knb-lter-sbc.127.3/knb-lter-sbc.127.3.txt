    These data provide coefficients to estimate the biomass of
    macroalgae, invertebrates and fish from field measurements of body
    size or percent cover. We developed quantitative relationships
    between mass and length or mass and percent cover, and conversion
    factors for transforming wet mass into dry mass, shell free and
    decalcified dry mass, and ash-free dry mass for taxa of benthic
    macroalgae and macroinvertebrates common to giant kelp forests in
    southern California. We also compiled literature-based relationships
    between mass and total length for reef fish common to giant kelp
    forests in southern California.

          The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate
            the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp
              (Macrocystis pyrifera ) forest ecosystems. As in many temperate
            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
            production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic
            interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.
