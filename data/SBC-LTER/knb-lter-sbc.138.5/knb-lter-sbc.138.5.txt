      These data describe the percent cover of eight bottom substrate
      types as determined by a uniform point contact method. The type of
      bottom substrate is recorded at 80 uniformly spaced points along
      permanent 40m x 2m transects. Percent cover of each substrate type
      on a transect is estimated as the proportion of the 80 points
      contacted by that substrate type x 100. In cases where the
      substrate type is sand, the depth of the sand is measured.
    
            
      These data are part of the SBC LTER’s time series observations of
      kelp forest dynamics, which began in 2000 and was designed to
      track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity of
      reef-associated organisms in the Santa Barbara Channel,
      California, USA. The sampling locations in this dataset include
      nine reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara
      Channel and two on the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These 11
      sites were chosen to reflect the wide range of oceanographic
      conditions present in the Channel and proximity to sources of
      terrestrial runoff. Data are collected at each site once per year
      in summer and this dataset is updated annually.
    
            
      The time period of data collection varied among the 11 reef sites.
      Sampling at BULL, CARP, and NAPL began in 2000, sampling at the
      other 6 mainland sites (AHND, AQUE, IVEE, GOLB, ABUR, MOHK) began
      in 2001 (transects 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 at IVEE were added in 2011). Data
      collection at the two Santa Cruz Island sites (SCTW and SCDI)
      began in 2004.
    
            
      The two tables in this data package include: 1) The percent cover
      of eight bottom substrate types; and 2) the sand depth of each
      sampling point (sand depth = 0 if substrate type ≠sand).

               The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
            
         
         
            SBC LTER is supported by the National Science Foundation.
