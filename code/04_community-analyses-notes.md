# total biomass models

Structure: biomass as a function of time since end, cluster biomass, and treatment and random effects of site and year  

Residuals: large residuals for middle of predicted range  

Tried: using tweedie (residuals look way worse), scaling response and predictors separately and together, taking out "outliers" which aren't actually outliers (?) but taking them out then messes up the dispersion.
